Create a dictionary that will store each word together with the count of the occurrence of each word in your sentence.
Print each item from the dictionary

x=input("Give me one sentences") 
y=input("Give me another sentences") 
print(x,y) 
z=x+" "+y 
split_z=z.split(' ') 
listofword=split_z

sortlistofword=sorted(listofword) 
print(sortlistofword) 
print(len(listofword))
