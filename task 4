Create a program that will keep track of items for a shopping list.
The program should start with an empty list and keep asking for new items until nothing is entered (no input followed 
by enter/return key).

The program should then display the full shopping list.

buy_list = []
x=0
while x==0: 
  z=input("What do you want to buy ?")
  buy_list.append(z) 
  if z=='': 
    print(buy_list) 
    break
